I am really excited about Clubhouse, its future and ðŸ‘‰ would love to join your team as an <code class=\"language-text\">iOS Software Engineer</code> ðŸ‘ˆ!</p>\n<p>I have learned a ton at Uber and I think itâ€™s time to start my next challenge; one of the reasons is that Uber doesnâ€™t move fast enough! To keep my passion for building products, I do lots of side projects and iOS apps.</p>\n<p>Most of them are social: Iâ€™m currently building a Social Trading app (I wrote about it <a href=\"https://lifegorithms.com/sotrade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>). I have also built a dating app based on speed dating, a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pushups-master/id1344312940\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">social workout app</a> and an app to <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coucou/id1506143712\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">easily keep in touch with your friends</a>.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™d like my focus to continue to be iOS because itâ€™s my passion, but I can help on the backend if needed as I started my career as a full stack engineer. I would also <code class=\"language-text\">LOVE</code> to get exposure to other parts of the business, like entrepreneurship, design, fundraising, and <a href=\"https://lifegorithms.com/hackathons-mentor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">continue to mentor</a>.</p>\n<p>I listen to your Townhall every Sunday, which gives me a good feeling about your team and makes me want to work with you!</p>\n<p>I also see so many things to work on, all super exciting: providing <code class=\"language-text\">analytics to moderators</code> (Iâ€™m a real data nerd), <code class=\"language-text\">accessibility</code> (solution for those hard of hearing), and the overall <code class=\"language-text\">scale of the product</code>!</p>\n<p>Would love to take some of your time to chat more!<br>\nYou can reach me at <code class=\"language-text\">papailhau@gmail.com</code>, or directly on Clubhouse <code class=\"language-text\">@papay0</code> (Arthur Papailhau)</p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing from you ðŸ¥³</p>\n<p>- Arthur<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-papailhau/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-papailhau/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/papay0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/papay0/</a></p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Clubhouse Â· iOS Software Engineer","date":"February 07, 2021","spoiler":"Kinda cover letter!","category":"job","published":false},"fields":{"slug":"/clubhouse-application/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/clubhouse-application/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/sotrade/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"sotrade"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reverse engineering Robinhood to create SoTrade ðŸ“ˆ"}},"next":null,"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
