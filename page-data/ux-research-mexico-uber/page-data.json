(at the time of writing this)<br>\nEven if I knew what Retriever was about, seeing this project in production “in real life”, and not just through our online metrics, adds a lot of value to it.<br>\nIt makes me realize even more that we’re building this feature for real people, and that it directly impacts their day, the way they work, so their life.<br>\nA few things surprised me about the way drivers handle Retriever.</p>\n<p>First, when they receive the notification “Payment due in 7 days”, they decide/hope to take more card trips so that their arrears will go down. I was surprised to see how well they were aware of that.<br>\nIf one day I’d receive this kind of notification, it’s a no brainer, I’d just go and pay right away!<br>\nSecond, drivers were used to the previous way of handling arrears; a link in an email.<br>\nBuilding a new flow/solution can seem straightforward for many of us, but I realized that many drivers were looking for a link to click, somewhere in the Retriever flow, so they were confused.<br>\nThis research trip showed me that it’s not as simple as pushing a new feature in production and expecting everyone to adopt it.<br>\nLastly, Retriever clearly impacts the way drivers plan their day.<br>\nSome were saying that they prefered to pay at OXXO rather than paying the arrears with a card.<br>\nIn order to do that, they need to take a break in their day. For some it was early in the morning before the beginning of their busy day, for others it was during the lunch break etc.  </p>\n<p>To conclude on that part, this week really showed me that our work directly impacts life of drivers.<br>\n<em>I knew that before, but didn’t realize it as much as now.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"mexico-\"><a href=\"#mexico-\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mexico 🇲🇽</h2>\n<p>I discovered this country through two cities; Merida and Mexico City.<br>\nWe were in Merida on Sunday, so we all took this opportunity to visit the state of Yucatan.<br>\nI also learned from my parents that I went to Yucatan when I was younger.<br>\nConclusion, think twice before bringing kids on a trip with you, because I didn’t remember much of my first time there! 🙄<br>\nI was surprised by the temperature difference between Merida (+30C) and Mexico City (+20C).<br>\nMany people told me that Mexico wasn’t safe.<br>\nI felt that Merida was safe, nice and kid friendly.<br>\nI have only been in the financial area of Mexico City, and it felt a bit less safe than Merida, but still okay to walk in the street by myself. I talked to a few people at the office about the safety of this city, they told me that they could walk alone in the city, maybe not at 4am.<br>\nOf course, like in any city, there are places not safe at all. Maybe more in Mexico City than Amsterdam!<br>\nConclusion on safety: positively surprised. 👍</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/52ab5/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 94.5945945945946%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Yucatan\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/fcda8/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/12f09/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png 148w,\n/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/e4a3f/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png 295w,\n/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/fcda8/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png 590w,\n/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/efc66/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png 885w,\n/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/c83ae/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png 1180w,\n/static/4af84fea68d9bff1e9984f0b2ab9af3e/52ab5/uber-research-trip-mexico-yucatan.png 1420w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2 id=\"cash-\"><a href=\"#cash-\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cash 💵</h2>\n<p>I was expecting 90% of trips to be with cash.<br>\nTurns out it is less than that.<br>\nI asked this question to all my drivers, and on average it seems to be around 60%.<br>\nSome were saying 50/50, other 70/30 and even 80/20, all for more cash than card trips.  </p>\n<p>Drivers knew exactly where to go to have more cash or card trips, for example they knew that north was a card trip area, and south was for cash.
